# ChroniclesPI

Priest Addon for Power Infusion.

- New Changes to include a return of Cooldown Duration to the current PI target if the cast fails rounded to two decimal points.
- Added SendChatMessage usage to better communicate the application of PI rather than using client Print messages.

Command to cast PI on the last person that whispered "POWER INFUSION" (in caps) to you:

	/pi

Command to cast PI on a specific player:

	/pi Name

Manually set target for the /pi command:

	/setpi Name

These commands can be used in macros.
